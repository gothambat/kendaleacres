	<h1>Sunday School</h1>

	<p>
		Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. (2 Timothy 2:15). It is our goal to provide the resources needed for our church family to learn the word of God in such a way that it not only becomes knowledge, but it impacts the way we live our daily lives.
	</p>

		<h1>Youth Ministries</h1>

	<p>
		Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. (Proverbs 22:6). With so much competing for the attention of our children today, we feel that it is vitally important to offer our children a Christ centered alternative. Our teachers are dedicated to providing an atmosphere in which our children can grow through Bible based teaching, hands on interaction, and relevant application to the world in which they live. We have activities for our youth throughout the year and take a group to Bible camp every summer.
	</p>
	
		<h1>Teen Ministries</h1>

	<p>
		Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. (1 Timothy 4:12). It is our goal to train our teens to use their talents to serve the Lord.
	</p>
	
	
			<h1>Van Ministry</h1>

	<p>
		And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled. (Luke 14:23) Our van ministry started out with a focus on bringing children to church and though that is still our main objective, the scope of the ministry has expanded. We now offer transportation for anyone who is unable to come to church on their own. We realize God has blessed us with a tool so that we may be a blessing to others. Please help support this ministry as we try to reach our community for Jesus Christ.
	</p>
	
			<h1>Women of Faith</h1>

	<p>
		This group of ladies meets on the second Wednesday of every month at 7:00pm. These meetings consist of Bible devotions, a time of prayer for those in need, and a time to take care of whatever business items should arise. They work together to help serve in the local church and to serve in our community.
	</p>
	

				<h1>Men's Ministry</h1>

	<p>
		Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.(1 Corinthians 16:13). What the church needs now more than ever is Godly men. It is our vision here at Kendale Acres to provide an atmosphere whereby our men can grow in the faith and knowledge of our Lord and then take that and put it to work in their daily lives. Our men meet the second Wednesday night of every month for a time of prayer, Bible Study, and fellowship. This group of men also plays a vital role in the daily operations and upkeep of our church facilities.
	</p>
	
	
				<h1>Music Ministry</h1>

	<p>
		Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; (Ephesians 5:19). Throughout the Bible, we find that music is a very important part of worshiping God. Our church choir offers an opportunity to blend these voices together as well as an opportunity to minister to the congregation in song. We also encourage individuals and groups to exercise the musical talents God has given them through special instrumental and vocal performances.
	</p>
	
	
				<h1>Outreach Ministry</h1>

	<p>
		Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: (Matthew 28:18-19) We believe that the great commission is just as much for today's church as it was for the early church when it was first spoken. In a world where so many are being overcome by the evil around us, it is critical that we go out into the highways and the hedges and compel people to come in.
